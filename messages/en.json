They always forget about the back side, or the butt. This bothers me a bit. Imagine that you are spending hours on perfecting the curves of an ass and nobody remembers how it looks like. Such a disappointment from an artist's side.\n\nWhile I was having a regular museum tour that I found via Meetup.com, I decided to collect stories under different photos of the statues and museum visitors. Different combinations of lightnings, statue positions, statue situations, visitors' locations and carefully chosen word combinations created an interesting collection. It became more interesting when I discussed my funnywise comments on the sculptures with other visitors."

Exploring hidden or visible details can make anyone to broaden their perspectives; enjoy their lives and visits deeper."

I will try to discuss very different topics by connecting them, from the theory of evolution to neighborly relations. It can have a different style of narration and touch on disturbing topics delicately. I hope to make you laugh while thinking by giving quick and intelligent answers to the curious questions of different characters. I have no doubt that there will be room for slang. :)"
